<h3>This is my first CSP Project. It is based on an arcade game called King of the Hammer where you try to hit a button, and the lights will appear higher up based on how hard you hit it.</h3>
<h3>For my game, the correct power input is 100. If you type in 100, all the lights will light up and the bulb at the top will turn green. If you don't put in the correct input, the lights won't go up all the way, and the bulb will turn red.</h3>

		<h3>My second project is heavily inspired by a gamed called Plants vs. Zombies. You are able to control a peashooter plant that shoots outs peas which kills the zombies it comes into contact with.</h3>
		<h3>You can play forever unless a zombie reaches the end of the yard. There are two zombies the program chooses randomly. If a does reach the end, the game ends, and you are able to see the score at the top right. </h3>

		  <h3>My third project is an electronic card for children at a children's hospital. Its main theme is superheroes. It asks for names and makes an endcard after using that input.</h3>
		  <h3>You can choose between superman or superwoman, and you can go right or left. Each direction has different animations. There wasn't many images for superwoman so we had to reuse some images.</h3>

			  <h3>My fourth project was based on cybersecurity using python. We had find suspicous files on our computer and try to find what they did.</h3>
			  <h3>We had to use various methods of debugging and decryption of different codes in order to put them together, and it resulted in this fish tank program. </h3>

			  <h3>This project used scratch to create a game similar to Pong. We had to add a variety of changes to make it more complicated.</h3>
			  <h3>Your score increases each time the asteroids bounce against the rockets, and lose points when they hit the vertical edges. The alien and spaceships are just obstacles.</h3>

			  <h3>This project was focused on creating a user friendly GUI to make it easier to navigate and use commands on python.</h3>
			  <h3>We had commands involved with IP addresses and DNS's and could input a URL to find information about it.</h3>

			  <h3>This project's goal was to successfully find the location of a rover on anb alien plant using the random data given to us. We sorted data on a spreadsheet using different methods including using values and number of digits. </h3>
			  <h3>After we plotted the data on graphs and analyzing, we concluded that the location was a tropical island based on the constant temperature, constant sounds, and intense lights.</h3>
