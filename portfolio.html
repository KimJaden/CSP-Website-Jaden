<h3>This is my first CSP Project. It is based on an arcade game called King of the Hammer where you try to hit a button, and the lights will appear higher up based on how hard you hit it.</h3>
<h3>For my game, the correct power input is 100. If you type in 100, all the lights will light up and the bulb at the top will turn green. If you don't put in the correct input, the lights won't go up all the way, and the bulb will turn red.</h3>
