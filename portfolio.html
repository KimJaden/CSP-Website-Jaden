<h3>This is my first CSP Project. It is based on an arcade game called King of the Hammer where you try to hit a button, and the lights will appear higher up based on how hard you hit it.</h3>
<h3>For my game, the correct power input is 100. If you type in 100, all the lights will light up and the bulb at the top will turn green. If you don't put in the correct input, the lights won't go up all the way, and the bulb will turn red.</h3>

		<h3>My second project is heavily inspired by a gamed called Plants vs. Zombies. You are able to control a peashooter plant that shoots outs peas which kills the zombies it comes into contact with.</h3>
		<h3>You can play forever unless a zombie reaches the end of the yard. There are two zombies the program chooses randomly. If a does reach the end, the game ends, and you are able to see the score at the top right. </h3>

		  <h3>My third project is an electronic card for children at a children's hospital. Its main theme is superheroes. It asks for names and makes an endcard after using that input.</h3>
		  <h3>You can choose between superman or superwoman, and you can go right or left. Each direction has different animations. There wasn't many images for superwoman so we had to reuse some images.</h3>
